	<h1>Arts</h1>
    
	<p>Besides the sciences, I also have a deep appreciation for the arts. In particular, I've been writing poetry and music since I was eight. I've independently released three original EPs and 20+ singles (alongside dozens of songs that I am...tactfully avoiding producing). My poetry has been published in several journals, including the UT Austin MFA program's magazine. In high school, I accumulated several Scholastic awards (a Gold Key, two Silver Keys, and four HMs) and had a prose piece in the Scholastic Awards Met exhibit in 2022!</p>
