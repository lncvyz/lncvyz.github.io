	<p>The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction.</p>
	<p>—Rachel Carson</p>

	<p>I’m Lance, and I'm like if a CS major was like, extremely hippie-dippie.</p>
	<p>My inspiration to become a scientist began as a kid hearing the Hippocratic Oath for the first time; although I’m not in medicine, every endeavor I take on starts with the principle of “first do no harm.” In my career, I hope to foster my passions for computational oceanography, human-computer interaction, software engineering ethics, the open-source movement, and more, and to do right by my fellow humans and the planet we inhabit.</p>
	<p>Currently, I study data science, computer science, and ethics at UMass, and I'm interning at the Hunter College VR REU investigating creative computing and HCI! You can find my creative work archived <a = href = "arts.html">here</a> and my analytical work archived <a = href = "analytical.html">here</a>.</p>
